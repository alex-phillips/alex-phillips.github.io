For my senior design project at NC State University, my team was to make an automated ID3 metadata extractor for MP3 files as well as a digital music jukebox that would ultimately be placed in social areas (such as coffee shops) around college campuses.

Essentially, the project was split into the two sub-projects: the metadata extractor and the digital jukebox. My portion of the project was dealing with the jukebox. The page itself was coded in PHP with jQuery and AJAX powering the dynamic search (so the page doesn't require a reload to populate the search, thus stopping the song from playing). For the actual audio player, we used the open-source jPlayer which uses HTML5 with a Flash fallback.
